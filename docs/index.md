# SeqLearner
SeqLearner is a multitask learning package for semi-supervised learning on biological sequences
SeqLearner is a high-level API, written in Python and capable of running on different embedding methods such as Freq2Vec, Word2Vec, Sent2Vec and etc. It also provides some visualizations to analyze the embedding.
It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

SeqLearner is compatible with: Python 3.6-3.7.
