# T-SNE
```python
seqlearner.MultiTaskLearner.visualize(method="TSNE", family=None, proportion=1.5)
```
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a (prize-winning) technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. 
The technique can be implemented via Barnes-Hut approximations, allowing it to be applied on large real-world datasets. 

You can find more information about this technique and its variants are introduced in the following papers:

We have used the sklearn wrapper function which implements T-SNE and applied it on the embedding results.
The `visualize` method has the following arguments:
### Arguments
- __method__: String, Possible values are `TSNE` and `UMAP`
- __family__: String, Name of protein family to be visualized
- __proportion__: Positive float, population proportion of number of other classes by number of 

## Apply T-SNE visualization on  MscL protein family
```python
from seqlearner import MultiTaskLearner as mtl
import pandas as pd
from seqlearner import Freq2Vec
sequences = pd.read_csv("./protein_sequences.csv", header=None)
freq2vec = Freq2Vec(sequences, word_length=3, window_size=5, emb_dim=25, loss="mean_squared_error", epochs=250)
freq2vec.freq2vec_maker()
freq2vec_embedding = mtl.embed(word_length=3, embedding="freq2vec", func="sum", emb_dim=25, gamma=0.1, epochs=100)
mtl.visualize(method="TSNE", family="MscL_family", proportion=2.0)
```
The visualization plot is in the following:
